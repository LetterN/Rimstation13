# Rimstation-13

Rimstation 13 is a mod intended to replicate as best as possible the functionality 
and atmosphere of Spacestation 13 in Rimworld as a singleplayer experience, it is an 
ongoing project due to the inherent complexity and massive amount of content contained in Spacestation 13. 
This mod is based on the /tg/ Branch of SS13 as it is the one I am most familiar with.
